## **What We Did in This Project üöÄ**  

### **1. Trend Analysis:**  
- **Goal:** Understand price movements and seasonal patterns.  
- **Steps Taken:**  
   - Calculated **yearly averages** for **Open** and **Close prices** to observe trends.  
   - Used **line charts** to visualize growth patterns.  
   - Analyzed **monthly patterns** with decomposition trees for cycles and seasonality.  

### **2. Volatility and Risk Analysis:**  
- **Goal:** Measure risk through volatility and examine volume-price relationships.  
- **Steps Taken:**  
   - Computed **daily price range (%):**  
     ```
     ([High] - [Low]) / [Open] * 100
     ```  
   - Highlighted spikes using **line charts** and **histograms**.  
   - Evaluated correlation between **volume and price swings** using **scatter plots**.  

### **3. Predictive Insights:**  
- **Goal:** Forecast future trends based on historical patterns.  
- **Steps Taken:**  
   - Used Power BI‚Äôs **Analytics Pane Forecast Tool** to project trends.  
   - Added **confidence intervals** to assess accuracy.  
   - Analyzed predictions over 6‚Äì12 months.  

### **4. Portfolio Optimization (Optional):**  
- **Goal:** Assess risk-adjusted performance using Sharpe Ratios.  
- **Steps Taken:**  
   - Computed **returns** and **volatility** in Power Query.
